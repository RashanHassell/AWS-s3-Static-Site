# AWS S3 Static Website Lab

This lab demonstrates how to host a static website using **Amazon S3**. It's part of my cloud learning journey and helps showcase hands-on experience with AWS services.

## 📌 What This Project Covers
- Creating and configuring an S3 bucket
- Uploading and serving a static `index.html` file
- Enabling public access and setting bucket policies
- Setting up static website hosting through AWS

## 🧪 Files Included
- `index.html` – the main landing page of the website
- *(Optional)* `error.html` – a custom error page for broken links or missing content

## 🌐 Live Site Example
